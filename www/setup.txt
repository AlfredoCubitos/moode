GENERAL INFORMATION

WebUI appears in the Browser use the IOS or Android "Save to Home Screen" option
to create a moOde App on the home screen. There is no need to download anything.
http://moode | http://moode.local | http://IP_ADDRESS

Instructions for navigating the moOde WebUI, searching the Library, Preference
and Configuration settings, Multiroom audio and other important information is
in "Quick help" which which is located on the "m" menu and at the link below.

MOODE OS IMAGE

For improved security the OS image does not contain a userid, WiFi SSID or
Hotspot password, and Secure Shell (SSH) access is disabled.

  1. REQUIRED: The official Raspberry Pi Imager is required to enable SSH,
  create a userid and password and optionally set the host name and WiFi SSID
  and password. If a host name is not set in the Imager then the default
  host name "moode" will be used.

  2. REQUIRED: Userid, password and SSH are required otherwise moOde will not
  function correctly. When enabling SSH, select "Use password authentication"
  which means the password specified for the userid is to be used.

  3. REQUIRED: A Hotspot password is required and is set after first boot
  in the Network Configuration screen. This allows moOde to still be accessable
  if it cannot connect to Ethernet or any configured WiFi SSID's.

- OS images are listed in the "Media Player OS" category of the Raspberry Pi
  Imager, or if they were downloaded directly from moodeaudio.org they can be
  selected via the "Use custom" category in the Imager.

- Refer to the links below for more information on operating system security
  and how to download and use the Raspberry Pi Imager.
  https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/
  https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-bullseye-update-april-2022/

To access the OS command console use SSH. An easy to use WebSSH terminal is
available in the System Config screen.

WIFI HOTSPOT

To access the Hotspot which is moOde's private 2.4 GHz WiFi network refer to the
default settings below.

- SSID          Moode
- Password      As set in Network Config screen
- URL           http://moode.local | http://172.24.1.1

The Hotspot starts automatically when any of the following are true.

- WiFi SSID is set to "Activate Hotspot" in Network Config.
- WiFi SSID is defined in Network Config but no IP address was assigned after
  attempting to connect to the configured SSID or any saved SSID's.

FILE SHARING

- SMB File Sharing can be turned on in System Config. SMB (Samba) shares named
  NAS, Playlists, and SDCard are automatically created. Each USB disk will also
  have a Samba share created that is named after its Disk Label.

- NFS File Sharing can be turned on in System Config. Access and options defaults
  are provided but can be manually overridden. Each USB disk will have an NFS
  export created whose path is /media/disk_label.

IN-PLACE SOFTWARE UPDATES

- Updates to moOde software are made available periodically and can be downloaded
  and installed by clicking "CHECK for software update" in System Config.
